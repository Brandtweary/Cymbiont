## Battle Report: The Defense of Fort Python 🛡️

### Timeline of Events
1. Initial chunker attack detected at the ramparts
2. Multiple defensive failures due to over-complicated JSON validation
3. Discovered critical vulnerability in prompt formatting
4. Simplified defensive systems
5. Achieved successful triple extraction
6. Victory secured through minimalist design

### Key Insights Learned 🔍
1. Over-engineering created vulnerabilities:
   - Complex JSON validation was a weakness
   - Nested try/except blocks obscured real issues
   - Too much defensive programming led to silent failures

2. Simplification was key to victory:
   - Strings in -> JSON out is the core pattern
   - Simple list-based triples work better than complex objects
   - Let the LLM handle the structure, we just parse the result

3. Logging saved the day:
   - Silent failures were our biggest enemy
   - Detailed logs revealed the true battle status
   - Debug mode essential for development

### Future Prospects 🚀
- Make JSON validation optional for flexibility
- Keep the core pipeline simple: text in, structured data out
- Build additional features on top of stable foundation
- Maintain clear logging for future battles

### Final Assessment
The scarecrow prototype proves that simple, focused systems can defeat complex threats. By keeping our core extraction pipeline minimal and well-logged, we've created a sustainable defense against future chunker attacks.
